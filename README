##Scala Twitter library
A scala implementation of the twitter API
This is a work in progress, so there may be large changes on a daily basis

twitterparser.scala contains all the networking code
tweet.scala is just a basic tweet holding object factory
dm.scala is the same for direct messages
twitter.scala is a really crude ui to interact with the library

scala_twitter can be compiled with fsc *.scala, and run with scala Twitter
scala_twitter has support for a config file with username and password, and generates one if there it is not found.

UI options are
:f -> friends timeline
:p -> public timeline
:r -> @replies
:d -> recieved direct messages
:q -> quit
:u -> update status
:? -> print list of commands
